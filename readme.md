# Neovim Config

## Inspiration(i.e. some yank action) keymaps and configs
* [LunarVim](https://github.com/lunarvim/lunarvim)
* [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua)
* [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)
* [IogaMaster](https://github.com/IogaMaster/neovim)

## Usage
* This is not a good config compared to the distros. I just refused to disable a bunch of bloat in other configs. Even tho my config is still slower (;-;).
